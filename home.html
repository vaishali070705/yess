    <hr><h1>DRIVING TRAFFIC TO YOUR SHOPIFY STORE</h1>
    <p>by Laura McLoughlin <br>

    <br>  It is easy to feel daunted by the competition. You are one among hundreds, maybe thousands, of
      Shopify and other eCommerce stores. Although you are pleased with your site and your products
      convince you, you must find some way of standing out in the crowd.<br>

      <br>Encouraging a regular footfall is at the heart of selling. It will help if you were visible if you want to
      be successful. Here we guide you through some of <a href="https://www.choruscommerce.com/shopify-marketing">the essentials of driving traffic to your Shopify</a>
      store. At the heart of these ideas is that the more people who visit, the higher the number of
      customers that click “complete purchase”.<br>

    <h1>SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMISATION</h1>
    <p><br>SEO is mainstream now across the internet. Most successful sites understand that Google has a <a href="C:\Users\91935\Desktop\web dev\htmt- personal site\jeo.html">set of criteria that you must employ</a>
   to be visible on search engines and so on the internet. These
  criteria aim to provide the user of Google with the best experience as possible, as only the most
  relevant sites with the most significant authority are listed on that first page.<br>

  <br>While this can feel threatening and exclusive, it is also an opportunity. If you research your keywords
  and phrases, those that your customers would type into a search engine, and litter these through
  your site, then you have a chance to be seen. Your SEO keywords should be in your product
  descriptions, in your headings and the backend of your website – so don’t forget the alt text for your
  images and the meta descriptions.<br>

  <br>pages. While your customer is unlikely to read this paragraph, you will have an opportunity to
  include the key phrases some more. Be aware; keyword stuffing draws penalties that drops you
  down the list. Make sure everything on your site is high-quality and of apparent worth to your
  reader. Just think: would the customer want to read this?<br>
